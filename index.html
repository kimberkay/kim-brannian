    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a very curious human. I never want to stop learning or growing. I am lucky to be raising two very curious little humans with my loving and supportive partner. The love of my family ignites my being and whole self. The love of doing good work stokes that fire.</p>
    <p>People. I have an extensive background working with and <em>on</em> people. The past ten years found me growing and sustaining many, many client relationships through my work as a hairstylist. I ran my own show renting a chair from a salon I loved and built my business with lot's of hard work. Though I am sad to be leaving it behind, I'm more excited to enter tech and see where I fit in and how I can best serve the industry.</p>
    <p>When I'm not working or herding my littles, you'll find me sewing clothes, hiking hills, lifting weights, cooking vegan yums, or knitting while watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</p>
